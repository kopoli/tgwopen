tgwopen is a program to open, create and list TGW-files.

The TGW-files are archive files for a game called Kohan: immortal
sovereigns. This program is especially intended for the Loki port of the
game. The main goal is to help in modifying the game, because the Loki port
does not support these "override"-directories as the windows version
does. Therefore the TGW-archives must be modified directly.

The source should be mostly C99 and POSIX compatible and it should compile
on modern Linux:ish systems. 

Compile:
  sh autogen.sh
  ./configure && make all

install:
  make install

run:
  tgwopen

Examples:

tgwopen list archive.TGW
Lists the files inside the archive

tgwopen extract archive.TGW --output-dir dir
extracts the files inside the archive and writes them into the directory dir
